This project is a recreation of an academic assignment originally done in C++ programming language. The goal was to create a Month Selector using various programming languages and technologies to demonstrate the ability to adapt and expand upon the original. 

In this assignment, create a program that reads a year number and month number from the user and respond with the name of the selected month and the number of days in that month, considering leap years.

## Requirements
- **Input**: Year (between 1800 and 2100) and Month (1 - 12).
- **Output**: Full name of the month and the number of days. 
- Handle leap years for February
- Validate the inputs and provide error messages for invalid inputs.
- If the year is invalid, do not ask for the month or display the number of days. 

## Objectives
- Develop skill in writing and editing code in various programming languages.
- Develop skill in reading and validating input values.
- Develop skill in designing and implementing decision-making logic. 
- Understand the consequences of errors in program logic.     

**Languages / Technologies**
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
    - Console and GUI
- Vue.js
